# Flight-Planner
Uses Depth First Search to determine most efficient possible flight path, based on either time or price, as queried by user


This program takes a text document from the user with an origin city, destination city, and either a 'C' or 'T' to determine whether to query for most efficient time, or cost. The program then looks through another text file which contains all flight paths with their costs and times. After storing this information, the program uses depth first search to find the top three most efficient flights as queried by the user, and outputs them in a third text file.
